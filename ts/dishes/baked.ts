    "In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies). Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be. Preheat oven to 180°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 10 cm of space between cookies and 5 cm of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown. Cool completely before serving.",

    "Coat the inside of 125 G ramekins with softened butter, then sprinkle with the granulated sugar, tilting to coat completely. Set aside on a rimmed baking sheet. Heat the heavy cream in a small pot until boiling. Pour the boiling cream over 120 ml dark chocolate in a small bowl and let sit for 3 minutes. Stir until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or store in the freezer for up to 3 months. Preheat the oven to 220°C. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine the remaining 170 G chocolate and the butter. Microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between, until completely melted. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs, egg yolks, brown sugar, salt, and vanilla with an electric hand mixer on medium-high speed until light and frothy, about 8 minutes. Gently fold the chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, being careful not to deflate the eggs. Add the flour and fold to incorporate. Divide half of the batter between the prepared ramekins. Add ½ tablespoon of the chilled ganache to the center of each ramekin, then scoop the remaining batter on top. Bake for 12 minutes, until the tops are set and the cakes begin to pull away from the sides of the ramekins. Let the lava cakes cool slightly, then invert onto plates. Dust with powdered sugar and garnish with berries. Serve immediately.",
