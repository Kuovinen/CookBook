    "Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a large wok over a high heat, then add the onion and fry until lightly browned, around 5 mins. Add the rice and ham, stir and toast for about 3 mins, then move to the side of the pan.Add the remaining oil, then tip in the egg mixture. Leave to cook a little, then mix in with the rice â€“ stir vigorously to coat the grains or, if you prefer the egg chunkier, allow to set for a little longer before breaking up and stirring through. Tip into a serving bowl and scatter over the spring onion to serve. You can also add sesame oil, ground white pepper and a splash of soy sauce to season.",
